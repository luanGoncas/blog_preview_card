## My process

- Setting CSS file and putting all raw elements on screen
- Using 'body' element to centralize all other elements
- The author section was made with flexbox (the other parts I thought it was unnecessary)
- The responsiveness was an easier part, since I reused older projects

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Code reuse is quite helpful and helps at reinforcement learning.
